# Zulip Desktop Client

This is an experimental replacement for the [Zulip Desktop
app](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-desktop) implemented in
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

The goal is to achieve feature-compatibility with the old desktop app
and then start adding cool features like easy support for
multi-account.
